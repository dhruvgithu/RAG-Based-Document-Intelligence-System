## 🌐 Live Demo
https://ai-document-app-rag-5tlazrsgzsysohmh8xyusz.streamlit.app/

An intelligent **AI-powered Document Question & Answer system** that allows users to upload a PDF (notes, PPT exports, documents) and ask questions in natural language.

The system retrieves relevant content from the document and generates **clear, user-friendly answers** in either:
- **Bullet points**, or
- **Short explanatory paragraphs**  

based on the **intent of the question**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload PDF documents
- 🔍 Semantic search using vector embeddings (FAISS)
- 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ✍️ Clean, summarized answers (no prompt leakage)
- 🧾 Bullet-point or paragraph answers based on question type
- ❌ Graceful fallback if the answer is not found
- 🌐 Deployed using Streamlit Cloud

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10**
- **Streamlit** – Web interface
- **LangChain** – RAG pipeline
- **FAISS** – Vector similarity search
- **Sentence-Transformers** – Local embeddings
- **facebook/bart-large-cnn** – Text summarization model

## 🧠 How It Works (RAG Flow)

1. PDF is uploaded by the user
2. Text is extracted and split into chunks
3. Chunks are converted into vector embeddings
4. FAISS retrieves the most relevant chunks
5. The LLM summarizes content based on the question
6. Output is formatted cleanly for the user
